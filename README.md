# Spider-Robot
Robotics class project
##Version 1:
Using wood sticks to prototype and servos to test out the movement of the robot's back leg

##Version 2:
Using plexiglas to prototype and servos to test out the movement, but the legs cannot carry the weight of the body and servos

##Version 3:
Using plexiglas with smaller dimension and servos to assembly our robot, the robot's part is way more stronger with shipping tape rather than electrical tape. After tesing several functions, the robot is able to responde to light level with photoresistor and perform different movement.
